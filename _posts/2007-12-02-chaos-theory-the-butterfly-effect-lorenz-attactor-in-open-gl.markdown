# Chaos Theory: The Butterfly Effect in Open-GL [Lorenz Attactor]

I was asked to deliver some work on chaos theory and my group choose Lorenz Attractor as object of study. It’s a really nice chaos function as you can learn in the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor) page dedicated to the subject.The work was developed in OpenGL but I’m pretty sure that it would have been easier to do so in PovRay. Ok, bad joke :P 

If you want to give the application the project is hosted at [github](https://github.com/dscape/isdgl).

You’ll need GCC, build-essentials and – who would of thought? – the OpenGL libraries. It’s all explained in a slightly demented [readme](https://github.com/dscape/isdgl/blob/master/README) file.
